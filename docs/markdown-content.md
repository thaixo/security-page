Our security team is comprised of security experts dedicated to improving the security of our organization. Our employees are trained on security incident response and are on call 24/7.

## Infrastructure

<!--- __Recommended for:__ Every company, except if you don’t collect sensitive user data or don’t have users. --->

<!--- __Explanation:__ This section is required in every security overview. It explains your overall infrastructure security. Your infra can either be a managed data center (AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku, etc.) or a physical data center (managed by you or a third-party). --->

<!--- __Customization:__ Add the sub-section(s) that fits your company. --->

### Cloud infrastructure

<!--- __Explanation:__ Use this section if your company’s infrastructure is based on a cloud provider. --->

<!--- __Customization:__ Minor customization. Choose your cloud provider. Delete irrelevant names and links. --->

All of our services run in the cloud. We don’t host or run our own routers, load balancers, DNS servers, or physical servers.
Our service is built on [Amazon Web Services | Google Cloud Platform | Microsoft Azure | Heroku |…]. They provide strong security measures to protect our infrastructure and are compliant with most certifications. You can read more about their practices here:
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/security/)
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/security/)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trustcenter/security)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/policy/security)

### Data center security

<!--- __Explanation:__ Use this section if you use a physical data center to store and process your data. --->

<!--- __Customization:__ Very customizable - You should detail the security efforts in your data center. Important points to mention are: locations (countries), [The data center tiers or certifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center#Data_center_levels_and_tiers), how the machines are separated from other data center customers, security controls (guards, power supply, etc.) --->

Our data center is located in the United States. It is a Tier IV, PCI DSS, and ISO 27001 compliant facility.
Our servers are physically separated from other data center customers.
The data center facilities are protected 24/7 with different security measures (guards, CCTV, electronic access control, etc.). Monitoring and alerting is in place for security breaches, power, HVAC, and temperature.

## Network level security monitoring and protection

<!--- __Recommended for:__ Every company. --->

<!--- __Customization:__ Medium customization. Delete the best practices you’re not following. --->

Our network security architecture consists of multiple security zones. We monitor and protect our network, to make sure no unauthorized access is performed using:
- A virtual private cloud (VPC), a bastion host or VPN with network access control lists (ACL’s) and no public IP addresses.
- A firewall that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.
- An Intrusion Detection and/or Prevention technologies (IDS/IPS) solution that monitors and blocks potential malicious packets.
- IP address filtering

## DDoS protection

<!--- __Recommended for:__ >Series B companies where availability is a big business risk (think e-commerce, business relying on ads or APIs, etc.). --->

<!--- __Explanation:__ DDoS attacks consist of flooding a target with excessive requests to overload systems and stop legitimate requests. DDoS attacks shouldn’t be a big concern for smaller websites. This section describes the tools in place to mitigate DDoS attacks. Add this section to your overview if you use a CDN like Cloudflare, Incapsula, Akamai, etc. --->

<!--- __Customization:__ No customization. You can name your provider. Delete section if no DDoS protection is in place. --->

## Data encryption

<!--- __Recommended for:__ Every company, except if you don’t collect sensitive user data or don’t have users. --->

<!--- __Explanation:__ This part explains the encryption strategy at rest and in transit. There is no good reason not to do data encryption from day one. From data in transit (check your website with [SSLLabs](https://www.ssllabs.com) to encryption at rest ([in a database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Overview.Encryption.html) or on your machine’s hard drives). To secure your user's passwords, you should either use [one-way encryption on salted passwords](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2016/09/how-dropbox-securely-stores-your-passwords/) or use [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt). --->

<!--- __Customization:__ You could add more information on your encryption strategy (e.g. algorithm used), but it’s not required. --->

Encryption in transit: All data sent to or from our infrastructure is encrypted in transit via industry best-practices using Transport Layer Security (TLS). You can see our SSLLabs report [here](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=bluechai.com)
Encryption at rest: All our user data (including passwords) is encrypted using battled-proofed encryption algorithms in the database.

## Data retention and removal

<!--- __Recommended for:__ Every company, except if you don’t collect sensitive user data or don’t have users. --->

<!--- __Explanation:__ It’s a good practice to delete user data if not used. This should ideally happen after a specific period and on user request (also required for GDPR). Use this section if you have procedures in place to remove user data (after a period or user request). --->

<!--- __Customization:__ Highly customizable. Adapt the section to reflect your practices and define “usage data” (it could be events, logs etc.). Link to your privacy page. --->

We retain your usage data for a period of 90 days after your trial. All data is then completely removed from the dashboard and server.
Every user can request the removal of usage data by contacting support.
